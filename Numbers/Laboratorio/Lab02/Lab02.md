# Debug Increment and Decrement Operator Errors in a Buggy App

Your friend has asked you to help them debug their code. They are practicing increment and decrement operators but are getting unexpected results in the console.

Your task is to help them identify the mistakes and update the code so that the console outputs match the expected results.

You can refer back to the prior lessons on increment and decrement operators as well as prefix and postfix notation.

## User Stories:

- You should have a variable named updatedCounter that correctly produces the value 11 by using the increment operator. Update the expression to use the correct prefix or postfix notation instead of hardcoding the value.
- You should have a variable named finalScore that correctly produces the value 8 by using the increment operator. Update the expression to use the correct prefix or postfix notation instead of hardcoding the value.
- You should have a variable named updatedCoins that correctly produces the value 2 by using the decrement operator. Update the expression to use the correct prefix or postfix notation instead of hardcoding the value.
- You should have a variable named newHealth that correctly produces the value 7 by using the decrement operator. Update the expression to use the correct prefix or postfix notation instead of hardcoding the value.

## Tests

1. Waiting:1. You should have a variable named updatedCounter that uses prefix increment notation (++counter).
1. Waiting:2. updatedCounter should equal to 11.
1. Waiting:3. You should have a variable named finalScore that uses postfix increment notation (score++).
1. Waiting:4. finalScore should equal to 8.
1. Waiting:5. You should have a variable named updatedCoins that uses prefix decrement notation (--coins).
1. Waiting:6. updatedCoins should equal to 2.
1. Waiting:7. You should have a variable named newHealth that uses postfix decrement notation (health--).
1. Waiting:8. newHealth should equal to 7.

## Code before

```js
let counter = 10;
console.log(`Counter is currently ${counter}`);

let updatedCounter = counter++;
console.log(`Counter is now ${updatedCounter}`);

let score = 8;
console.log(`Score is currently ${score}`);

let finalScore = ++score;
console.log(`Score is still ${finalScore}`);

let coins = 3;
console.log(`Coins is currently ${coins}`);

let updatedCoins = coins--;
console.log(`Coins is now ${updatedCoins}`);

let health = 7;
console.log(`Health is currently ${health}`);

let newHealth = --health;
console.log(`Health is still ${newHealth}`);
```

## Code after

```js
let counter = 10;
console.log(`Counter is currently ${counter}`);

let updatedCounter = ++counter;
console.log(`Counter is now ${updatedCounter}`);

let score = 8;
console.log(`Score is currently ${score}`);

let finalScore = score++;
console.log(`Score is still ${finalScore}`);

let coins = 3;
console.log(`Coins is currently ${coins}`);

let updatedCoins = --coins;
console.log(`Coins is now ${updatedCoins}`);

let health = 7;
console.log(`Health is currently ${health}`);

let newHealth = health--;
console.log(`Health is still ${newHealth}`);
```
